    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>An accomplished IT professional with a strong focus on client satisfaction and a practical background in continuous improvement. My journey
    began in the provincial government of Ontario, where I gained recognition as a subject matter expert and received recognition for my technical
    comprehension and teamwork abilities, which naturally led to my progression into the field of IT. During a period of self-employment, I honed
    my skills and provided strategic technical guidance to online businesses. My career took an exciting turn into the higher education sector,
    where I've excelled in delivering solutions at an enterprise level. I possess a unique talent for simultaneously handling the big picture and
    fine details, thriving on complex problem-solving while embracing creative challenges.
